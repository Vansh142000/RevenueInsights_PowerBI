# RevenueInsights And Performance Analysis

## Problem Statement

The Atliq Hotels project focused on analyzing hotel performance metrics to uncover potential areas for improvement in pricing strategies and operational efficiency. The challenge was to create an insightful dashboard to track and compare key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

- Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Occupancy Rates
- Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)

The ultimate goal was to enable data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry.

## Purpose

This project aimed to provide Atliq Hotels with a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring crucial KPIs, enabling the identification of trends and patterns in hotel performance. By leveraging Power BI for data visualization and DAX for enhanced data analysis, the project sought to deliver actionable insights to inform strategic decisions, particularly in pricing and revenue management.

## Aims

- **Optimize Revenue Strategies**: Identify opportunities for dynamic pricing and suggest adjustments to maximize revenue based on demand variations.
- **Enhance Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Empower hotel management to make informed decisions through a clear, visual representation of performance data.
- **Improve Occupancy Rates**: Analyze the correlation between occupancy rates and other factors such as ADR and hotel ratings to increase overall occupancy.
- **Evaluate and Refine KPIs**: Assess existing KPIs and propose additional metrics or visualizations that offer a more complete picture of hotel performance.

## Insights and Solutions

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Opportunity

The analysis revealed a static pricing strategy where ADR remained constant despite fluctuations in occupancy rates. This indicated a missed opportunity to implement dynamic pricing strategies that adjust room rates based on demand. Introducing dynamic pricing could potentially increase revenue by capitalizing on high-demand periods.

### 2. Weekday vs. Weekend Pricing

Minimal differences were found between weekday and weekend pricing. The analysis suggested that implementing differentiated pricing could maximize revenue, particularly for hotels that experience higher demand on weekends.

### 3. Correlation Between Ratings and Occupancy

A clear correlation was observed between hotel ratings and occupancy rates, with lower-rated hotels experiencing lower occupancy. This insight suggested that focusing on improving service quality and enhancing online ratings could directly impact occupancy and, consequently, revenue.

### 4. Impact of Cancellations

High cancellation rates were identified in hotels with low occupancy and ratings. This suggested that guests might be booking these hotels as backup options and canceling them later. Improving the guest experience to reduce cancellations could positively affect occupancy rates.

### 5. Data-Driven Decision-Making

The dashboard provided Atliq Hotels with a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions. The insights derived from the data analysis offered actionable recommendations, such as adopting dynamic pricing, refining pricing strategies based on day-of-week patterns, and focusing on improving guest ratings to boost occupancy.

## Conclusion

This project successfully delivered a comprehensive Power BI dashboard highlighting key performance metrics for Atliq Hotels. The insights generated from the data analysis identified several areas for potential improvement, particularly in pricing strategies and operational efficiency. By addressing these areas, Atliq Hotels can optimize revenue and improve overall hotel performance.
